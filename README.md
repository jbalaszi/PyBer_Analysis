# PyBer_Analysis
ride-sharing analysis - Module 5

## Overview
#Purpose
Provide data visual techniques to a ride-sharing company, called PyBer, using a summary DataFrame identifying trends and difference among city type. Ride-sharing data key metrics will be illustrated with pie charts, scatter plots, and a summary table.

#Resources
- Python
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv

##Results
PyBer has three city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. Urban cities have the highest number of drivers and riders. Next is Suburban then ending with Rural. While Rural has the least amount of drivers and riders, this city type yields the highest average fare per ride at $34.62. The average fare per ride for Urban and Suburban is $30.97 and $24.53 respectively. However, we do not know if Rual cities high mean fare price is due to long drive durations as things tend to be more spread out in rural areas. (References: Figs. 5-7)

Urban is PyBer's overall top competitor yielding the highest total rides and drivers, and total fares. Having the largest number of drivers and rides contributes to Urban cities lower fare (average fare per driver is $16.57). Suburban cities coming in at second and Rural cities at last in all the same metrics. The number of total fare for Urban, Suburban and Rural are consistent throughout the year with a few spikes near the end of February and beginning of April. (Reference: Fig 8)

##Summary
Based on these findings, it is clear Urban cities yields the highest total revenue for PyBer. The CEO could look into the cause for high average prices for drivers and rides in Rural areas. Further investigation for high prices could lead to innovating ways to increase the number of rides and decrease the average fare for rides and drivers. Rural areas could look for ways to decrease the large average fare per driver cost such as if drivers leave their car idling.
